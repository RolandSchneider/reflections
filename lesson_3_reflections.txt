When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  mainly three reasons: 1) For backup. To store my program on a second machine, 
  so I still have acceess to my program code even if my own computer crashes.
  2) To share a program with other developers. 3) To have a central repository that
  can act as a reference.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Probably beause I want to synchronize only at certain times.
	At start of work, for example.
