When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  mainly three reasons: 1) For backup. To store my program on a second machine, 
  so I still have acceess to my program code even if my own computer crashes.
  2) To share a program with other developers. 3) To have a central repository that
  can act as a reference.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	i don't want to duplicate my local repository on remote. For instance,
	it would get cluttered very soon if a lot of developers pushed everything on origin.
	Also, its much clearer to commit only at well - defined points.
